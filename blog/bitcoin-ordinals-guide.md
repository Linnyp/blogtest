# Introduction

Bitcoin Ordinals represent a groundbreaking development in the Bitcoin ecosystem, introducing the concept of digital artifacts directly inscribed onto individual satoshis. This revolutionary approach has opened up new possibilities for digital ownership, art, and collectibles on the world's most secure blockchain.

## What Are Bitcoin Ordinals?

Ordinals are a way to inscribe arbitrary data onto individual satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin. Each satoshi can be uniquely identified and tracked through what's called the "ordinal theory," which assigns each satoshi a unique number based on the order in which it was mined.

### Key Features

- **Immutable**: Stored directly on Bitcoin blockchain
- **Unique**: Each ordinal has a unique identifier based on satoshi numbering
- **Scarce**: Limited by Bitcoin's block space and mining schedule
- **Decentralized**: No reliance on external servers or IPFS

## How Ordinals Work

The process involves inscribing data directly onto individual satoshis using the Taproot upgrade's capabilities. Here's how it works:

1. **Satoshi Selection**: Choose which satoshi to inscribe
2. **Data Preparation**: Prepare the content (image, text, audio, etc.)
3. **Inscription Process**: Create a transaction that includes the data
4. **Blockchain Storage**: The data becomes permanently part of the Bitcoin blockchain

### Technical Implementation

Ordinals leverage several Bitcoin features:
- **Taproot**: Enables efficient data storage
- **Witness Data**: Stores inscription content
- **PSBT**: Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions for inscription creation

## Popular Ordinal Collections

Several notable collections have emerged:

- **Ordinal Punks**: Bitcoin's answer to CryptoPunks
- **Bitcoin Rocks**: Digital collectible rocks on Bitcoin
- **Ordinal Maxi Biz**: Business-themed ordinals
- **OnChain Monkey**: Migrated from Ethereum to Bitcoin
